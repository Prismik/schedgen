# Schedule Generator

After few sessions of university, I came to realize that the schedule generator provided was very bad (and ugly). I always tweaked the html file that the system was giving me and eventually got tired to do so. This is when I decided that I would make my own schedule generator to simplify this process for any schedules I would have to make from now on.

## Installation

This generator can basically be run from any browser. You will probably need to have access to internet, since I have settled for google's JQuery hosting services.

## Usage

Try to drag, drop and resize stuff and enjoy !
